# Evapotranspiration-App

Evapotranspiration Web App — ( team project )

This is a website which is capable of calculating evapotranspiration of any place in the world with just inputing name of place and minimal data.<br>
This was our group project. <br>
In this project first of all we researched how to calculate evapotranspiration using `Penman-Monteith` equation for this we used `FAO 56` research paper.
Then we converted it into a working code to minimise the inputs we used APIs to fetch data according to place. 
Then we computed the result on the basis of data fetched and showed on the ui using dom manipulation.



# API used

- Used OPEN SOURCE API of open-meteo.com to fetch the required
meteorological data for calculation of evapotranspiration of any place in
the world.

- Used GEOCODER API of openWeatherMap.com to get the coordinates of
place from it’s name.
